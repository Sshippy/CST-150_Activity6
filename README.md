Extend the program written for Activity 2 by adding exception handling to the program. Further enhance your project by formatting all numeric output to exactly three decimal places and include a screenshot of your program running with successful output. Make the interface attractive and clean.

What did you learn?
What I learned from this assignment is how to use exception handling and decimal places. 

What were the challenges if any?
The challenge that I found to run across was which exeption to handle. I did research on different ones that could be used and I settled on "throws new NotImplementedException().
